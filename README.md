# 🌱 Crop Disease Identifier
This project helps farmers and researchers identify crop diseases using Deep Learning (CNNs). Simply upload an image of a leaf, and the model will predict the disease with high accuracy. This tool can be a community-driven solution for early disease detection, reducing crop loss.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
✅ Python – Main programming language
✅ TensorFlow/Keras – Deep Learning model
✅ OpenCV – Image preprocessing
✅ Matplotlib – Image visualization
✅ Tkinter – GUI for image upload

📌 Train the model once, then predict any image with a single click!
